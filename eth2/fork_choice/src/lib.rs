//! This crate stores the various implementations of fork-choice rules that can be used for the
//! beacon blockchain.
//!
//! There are four implementations. One is the naive longest chain rule (primarily for testing
//! purposes). The other three are proposed implementations of the LMD-GHOST fork-choice rule with various forms of optimisation.
//!
//! The current implementations are:
//! - [`longest-chain`]: Simplistic longest-chain fork choice - primarily for testing, **not for
//! production**.
//! - [`slow_lmd_ghost`]: This is a simple and very inefficient implementation given in the ethereum 2.0
//! specifications (https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/v0.1/specs/core/0_beacon-chain.md#get_block_root).
//! - [`optimised_lmd_ghost`]: This is an optimised version of the naive implementation as proposed
//! by Vitalik. The reference implementation can be found at: https://github.com/ethereum/research/blob/master/ghost/ghost.py
//! - [`protolambda_lmd_ghost`]: Another optimised version of LMD-GHOST designed by @protolambda.
//! The go implementation can be found here: https://github.com/protolambda/lmd-ghost.
